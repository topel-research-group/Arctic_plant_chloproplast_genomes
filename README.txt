# Arctic_plant_chloproplast_genomes
The target of this project is to extract chloroplast transcribed sequences for phylogenetic analysis for 360 Arctic plants found in artificial warming expiriments within ITEX (International Tundra Experiment).
Subfolders (00-03) contain the workflow from illumina (version) sequencing output to annotated genes.
